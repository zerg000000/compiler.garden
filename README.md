# compiler.garden

Integrant methods for compiling Garden files to CSS in the Duct framework.

## Installation

To install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:

```clojure
[zerg000000/compiler.garden "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage

The library provides the `:duct.compiler/garden` key, and is used to compile Garden styles in namespaces to CSS in development and production environments.

```clojure
:duct.compiler/garden
 {:builds [{:id "main"
            :stylesheet example.style/screen
            :compiler {:output-to "target/resources/example/public/css/style.css"
                       :pretty-print? false}}]}
```

The `:builds` option is mandatory. `:stylesheet` is a var contain the garden stylesheet datastructure. The `[:compiler :output-to]` option is where the garden compiler output the CSS file to. You can have multi CSS files compiled, just by defining more build. the `:compiler` will pass to garden compiler directly, you can get more detail about configuration from (Garden)[https://github.com/noprompt/garden]

 
In order to get auto css refresh in development mode, the css must be either output to the duct default css path `resources/baywatch/public/css` or define the css path explicitly in `dev.edn`.

```clojure
:duct.server/figwheel
{:css-dirs ["target/resources/example/public/css" "resources/example/public/css"]
 :builds [...]}
```
